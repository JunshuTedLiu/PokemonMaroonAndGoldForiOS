# Pokemon: Maroon And Gold for iOS
<h4>- UNDER CONSTRUCTION -</h4>

Pokemon Maroon and Gold. A Pokemon-style mini game for iOS.<br>

(This will be a continuation of the final project, <a href="https://github.com/JunshuTedLiu/PokemonMaroonAndGoldForMac">Pokemon: Maroon and Gold</a>, which was a final project for the Mac Dev class.)

<h2>Description</h2>
A pixelated Pokemon-style 2D game. The user can control Ash, the character, and his goal is to collect "secret items" inside the Tempe campus.

<h2>How to use?</h2>
The UI will look like a Gameboy controller. You need to press the direction button on the screen to control the character.

<h3>Update Log</h3>
This project is currently under construction.<br>
Currently, I need to fix the buttons to implement the function of skipping screens and moving characters.<br>
<br>
Ver 1.0 alpha 1 - April 16, 2018<br>
- Start working on the iOS version.
